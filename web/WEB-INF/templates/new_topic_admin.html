                    personally, I think that the social side of things and developing as a person are equally important.
                    The good thing about university life is that you are left to your own devices, unlike school, where
                    you're told what to do and how to do it. It's important to socialise and meet new friends. lt takes
                    some people longer than others. If a student has any problems, about anything, there's student
                    counselling available at all universities, where they try and help out as much as possible. I've
                    been a volunteer for our Student Counselling Scheme for some time now. I've found it very rewarding,
                    not only with helping other students through university life but also as an extra-curricular
                    activity.</a>
